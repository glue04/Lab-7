			War, war never changes. In the year 1945, my great-great grandfather, serving in the army,<br> 
			wondered when he get to go home to his wife and the son he never see. He got his wish, when the U.S.<br> 
			ended WWII by dropping an atomic cloud on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <br>
			The world awaited Armageddon, instead, something miraculous happened. We began to use atomic energy <br> 
			as a nearly limitless source of power. People enjoyed luxury once thought in the realm of science fiction.<br> 
			Domestic robots, fusion powered cars, portable computers. Then, in the 21st century, <br>
			people awoke from the American dream. Years of consumption led to the shortages of every major resource. <br>
			The entire world unraveled. Peace became a distant memory. It is now the year 2077, and we stand on the<br> 
			brink of total war, and I am afraid, for myself, for my wife, for my infant son, <br>
			because if my time in the army taught me one thing; is that war, war never changes.<br>
